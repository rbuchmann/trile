# Trile

A clojure tool and some dirty shell helpers to help you compile cljs
scripts on the fly.

# Requirements

md5sum, readlink, leiningen.

## Usage

- Run ./install.sh

- Put the trile executable on your path

Write any clojurescript for node with the

```
#!/path/to/trile
```

shebang. Example:

```clojure
#!/path/to/trile

(defn -main [& args]
  (go (println (<! (stdin->chan))))
  (println "Hello world!"))
```

core.async functions will be magically available, as well as a function stdin->chan and clojure/tools.cli.

Scripts will be compiled when changed, and just called otherwise.

Have fun!
